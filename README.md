The BoxTurtle is a significant improvement over the ERCF V2, which I had a very bad experience with. However, in my opinion, it’s still not fully mature. I encountered some frustrating issues with the extruder sensors—perhaps due to the specific sensors I received in the kit, or maybe it’s just a matter of poor component selection.

That said, I’ve had consistently good results with the steel ball + Omron D2F-01 sensor combination, which is commonly used in many filament sensing assemblies. So, why not use the same approach here as well?![sideview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ad1acc4-f095-44ef-b487-c4ea9cac81fd)
